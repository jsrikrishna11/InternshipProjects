data manipulation work:
    4. update and delete  data into the collection 
    n. Create AWS account - trail account 

optimization:
    1. clean up the way you deal with query results. 
    2. Find a better way to put recordset into tables.

New workflow:
    1. Expander on name tag itself in the edit details - expand and collapse jquery
    2. Employee page load -> list of all emps with jquery expandable panel -> show only 5
    employees and add pagination
        Search bar - as you search refresh the page
    functions:
        1. Search suggestions
        2. pagination
        3. expand-collapse (collapsable)
        4. page filtering
